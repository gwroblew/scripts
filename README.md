# scripts

The contents of my `/usr/local/bin`: useful scripts that are too small to
warrant their own page.

# Disclaimer
Some of these were meant to solve a one-off problem, so they are the code
equivalent of this:

Use at your own risk!

But some others I have spent more time on, and are pretty cool/work well. Here
are some of the best scripts in this repo:

 - `cover`: display album covers for music playing in mpv
 - `licenser`: put a license in your project with one command
 - `fzf_run`: replace dmenu with a normal terminal & fzf
 - `play`: search for and play music with mpv simply
 - `play?`: query metadata for currently playing music
 - `singleton`: kill old instances of a program so one copy runs at a time
 - `switch_focus`: global Alt-Tab for Sway
